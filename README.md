**Superseded by Simscape/Simulink model found at: https://github.com/icl-rocketry/PropulsionSystemModel**

Updated(Simscape/simulink) model improvements over this one:

- Coupled with better modelled upstream Nitrous feed system
- Can also model when nitrous flow turns gaseous near end of burn
- Models the chamber pressure as unsteady, giving better results for changing nitrous and fuel grain mass fluxes
- Has more datapoints for the combustion products (WIP)
- Easier to unstand as more visual to interact with and equations can be directly annotated onto the canvas (using latex syntax for symbols)
